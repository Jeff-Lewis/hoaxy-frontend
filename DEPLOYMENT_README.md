# Deployment

## Summary

If changes to the Hoaxy interface are made, the updates need to be deployed before they will appear on the live site.

General changes to the functionality of the interface should be made to the `master` git branch and then merged into this `deployment` branch.

Changes specific to the live Branded Hoaxy Website at <http://hoaxy.osome.iu.edu> can and should be made directly to this `deployment` branch.  This includes updates to the FAQ or changes to the Hoaxy or IU branding not found in the generic version.

## Instructions

### Method 1 - Updating directly on `lisa`

1) Log into `lisa` using the truthy user.
2) cd to the repository: `cd /home/data/apps/hoaxy/hoaxy-frontend`
3) Confirm that you are on the development branch: `git branch` should display a list of branches and `deployment` should have a  `*` next to it as follows:

        truthy@lisa:~/home/data/apps/hoaxy/hoaxy-frontend$ git branch
        * deployment
          master
        truthy@lisa:~/home/data/apps/hoaxy/hoaxy-frontend$
4) If not on `deployment` branch, switch branch to deployment using `git checkout deployment`
5) Make changes using your favorite editor (e.g. `nano frontend/faq.html`).  Save your work.
